## General dimensions

OpenArm has a small human-like physique. The support pillars are made of MiSUMi aluminum frames, making it easy to adjust the dimensions and attach cameras, sensors, and other attachments.
The base plate has evenly spaced M6 taps, allowing it to be fixed directly to a table or other surface.
Each joint has a mechanical limit that restricts the range of motion for safety.
